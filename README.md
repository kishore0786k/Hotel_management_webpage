# Hotel Management Webpage

This is a front-end hotel management application built as a learning project using React.
The goal of this project was to design a realistic hotel booking interface and implement
basic booking management without using a backend.

The application allows users to view hotel rooms, make a booking, and manage bookings
through an admin page. All data is stored in the browser using LocalStorage.
